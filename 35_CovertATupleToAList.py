# Write a program to covert a tuple into a list.
# Algorithm: 1_Initialize a tuple with the desired elements. 2_Use the list() function to covert the tuple into a list. 3_Print the coverted list.

#Initialize a tuple
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

#Covert tuple  to list
my_list = list(my_tuple)

#Print the converted list
print("List after converting from tuple:", my_list)
